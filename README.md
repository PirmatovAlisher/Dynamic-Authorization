I implemented permission-based authorization in a Blazor Server application (Blazor SSR), where the system administrator can grant and revoke specific permissions to roles and users. 


Let's run through the app's logic:

Default Role Assignment
Upon registration, the application automatically assigns a default role to the new user. This role comes with a predefined set of permissions.

Permission Model
The permission model is structured with the following properties:

Id: A unique identifier for the permission.
Name: Represents the method or action name.
Resource Type: Refers to the associated page or resource name.
Permissions are defined during the development phase and registered as policies within the AddAuthorization method.

Permission Loading and Enforcement
When the application initializes, it retrieves all permissions from the database. This enables dynamic authorization checks to determine whether a user has the necessary permissions to:

View specific content on a page.
Trigger designated actions.
If the user possesses the appropriate permissions, the content is displayed, or the action is executed. Otherwise, the system redirects the user to an "Access Denied" page.

Conclusion
This permission-based approach is especially beneficial for businesses with roles that are not rigidly defined or subject to frequent changes. By adopting this method, administrators can dynamically grant and revoke specific permissions for both roles and individual users, ensuring flexibility and control over access management.

Here are the pictures of the app:
